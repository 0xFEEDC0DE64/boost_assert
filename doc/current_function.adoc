## BOOST_CURRENT_FUNCTION

The header `<boost/current_function.hpp>` defines a single macro, `BOOST_CURRENT_FUNCTION`,
similar to the C99 predefined identifier `\\__func__`.

`BOOST_CURRENT_FUNCTION` expands to a string literal containing 
the (fully qualified, if possible) name of the enclosing function. If there is
no enclosing function, the behavior is unspecified.

Some compilers do not provide a way to obtain the name of the current enclosing
function. On such compilers, `BOOST_CURRENT_FUNCTION` expands to
`"(unknown)"`.
